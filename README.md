### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aijia Wang! A future software developer.  I have years of experiences of customer service. I love puzzle-solving. I am passionate about coding because it lets me explore different methods to solve a problem and brings out my creativity. I enjoy various challenges and enjoy the feeling of accomplishing difficult tasks. As an ever-developing field, coding enables me to constantly grow and expand my knowledge and skills.After realizing that I could reach my dream goal, I joined App Academy, a six month immersive full time software developing course (Full Stack) with over 1,000 hours of classes, homework and projects. I had the ability to learn fast and completely various techonologies like PostgreSQL, Javascript, Python, React, just to name a few.
